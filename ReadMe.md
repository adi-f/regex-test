# Simple Regular Expression Checker Helper
This is a small Java application (Swing UI) that let
you enter a Regular Expression and a sample value and
reports if the sample matches the RegEx.

Key Points:
* Maven project builds an executable JAR
* Kept simple & stupid: One single Java source file
* One external dependency (Apache commons-text)

## NEW: regex-test.html
Does the same as the Java application does but uses JavaScript (different Regex implementations have different features/behavior).
